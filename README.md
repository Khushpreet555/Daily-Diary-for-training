### Different job fields in cse
it helps me to set a proper goal for my future job in this field.


### Difference among product based company and service based company
product based company focuses on selling products while service based companies focuses on providing services.
there is more growth in product based companies.
example of product based company is google, microsoft, amazon, flipkart,etc.
example of sservice based company is infosys,wipro.

### Definition of Dual Boot
Dual boot is a computer configuration in which two operating systems are installed on the same device, allowing the user to choose which one to start (or "boot") at startup.

### VMware:
VMware is a company that creates software for virtualization, and its products (like VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, and VMware ESXi) allow you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine — at the same time.
### Bare Metal Installation:
A bare metal installation means installing an operating system or software directly onto the hardware of a computer, without any underlying host OS or virtualization layer.

### Partitioning Scheme — Definition and Overview
A partitioning scheme is the way a hard drive or storage device is divided into separate, independent sections called partitions. Each partition can hold a different filesystem or operating system.

MBR (Master Boot Record)	Traditional partitioning scheme used since early PCs. Contains partition table and bootloader code in the first sector
GPT (GUID Partition Table)	Modern scheme that stores partition info using globally unique IDs. Supports larger disks and more partitions.

 # Day3:
 ## File and directory permission:
 ## chmod (Change mode): It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

### Some different chmod permission notations are:
1.chmod +x filenamet.sh: Gives permission to run the script.

2.chmod 444 filename.sh: Changes file to read-only

3.chmod 644 filename.sh: give permission only to owner to edit.

### Redirection:

It allows user to redirect input and output functionalities to the files or folders.

### Types of Redirection:

1.Overwrite Redirection (For stdout):
Redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists already contain script, it will be overwritten.
">" standard output
2.Append Redirection :
Append the output to the file without compromising the existing data of the file.
3.Overwrite redirection :
used for input of command to file "<".

## 🧠 Difference Between RAM and Cache

| **Aspect**           | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**                                | **Cache Memory**                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧩 **Purpose**        | Temporary storage for data and programs in use                | Stores frequently used data/instructions for quick access    |
| 📍 **Location**       | Installed on the motherboard as separate modules              | Built into or close to the CPU core                          |
| ⚡ **Speed**          | Fast, but slower than cache                                   | Extremely fast                                              |
| 📏 **Size**           | Larger (4GB–64GB or more)                                     | Smaller (2MB–64MB typically)                                |
| 🧪 **Types**          | DDR4, DDR5, etc.                                               | L1, L2, L3 cache levels                                      |
| ⏱️ **Access Time**    | Higher latency than cache                                     | Very low latency                                             |
| 🔋 **Volatility**     | Volatile (data lost when power is off)                        | Also volatile                                                |
| ⚙️ **Control**        | Managed by the operating system                               | Managed by the CPU                                           |

## Why Do We Need Cache?
The CPU is incredibly fast, but accessing data from the main memory (RAM) takes comparatively longer. To bridge this speed gap, cache memory acts as a super-fast, small storage area located very close to the CPU.

Cache stores frequently used data and instructions, so the CPU can access them quickly without waiting for slower RAM.

This reduces the average time to access memory, improving overall system performance.

Without cache, the CPU would spend more time idling, waiting for data to arrive from RAM, slowing down computing tasks.

| 📏 **Size**          | Smaller capacity (usually 4GB to 64GB or more)             | Larger capacity (hundreds of GBs to multiple TBs)    |
| 🧪 **Purpose**       | Stores data and programs currently in use                  | Stores files, programs, and operating system long-term|
| 🔋 **Data Retention**| Data lost when power is turned off                          | Data retained even when power is off                  |
| 📍 **Location**      | Installed on the motherboard                                | Connected via SATA, NVMe, or other interfaces         |
