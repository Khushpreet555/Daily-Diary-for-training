### Definition of Dual Boot
Dual boot is a computer configuration in which two operating systems are installed on the same device, allowing the user to choose which one to start (or "boot") at startup.

### VMware:
VMware is a company that creates software for virtualization, and its products (like VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, and VMware ESXi) allow you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine — at the same time.
### Bare Metal Installation:
A bare metal installation means installing an operating system or software directly onto the hardware of a computer, without any underlying host OS or virtualization layer.

### Partitioning Scheme — Definition and Overview
A partitioning scheme is the way a hard drive or storage device is divided into separate, independent sections called partitions. Each partition can hold a different filesystem or operating system.

MBR (Master Boot Record)	Traditional partitioning scheme used since early PCs. Contains partition table and bootloader code in the first sector
GPT (GUID Partition Table)	Modern scheme that stores partition info using globally unique IDs. Supports larger disks and more partitions.

 # Day3:
 ## File and directory permission:
 ## chmod (Change mode): It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

### Some different chmod permission notations are:
1.chmod +x filenamet.sh: Gives permission to run the script.

2.chmod 444 filename.sh: Changes file to read-only

3.chmod 644 filename.sh: give permission only to owner to edit.

### Redirection:

It allows user to redirect input and output functionalities to the files or folders.

### Types of Redirection:

1.Overwrite Redirection (For stdout):
Redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists already contain script, it will be overwritten.
">" standard output
2.Append Redirection :
Append the output to the file without compromising the existing data of the file.
3.Overwrite redirection :
used for input of command to file "<".

## 🧠 Difference Between RAM and Cache

| **Aspect**           | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**                                | **Cache Memory**                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧩 **Purpose**        | Temporary storage for data and programs in use                | Stores frequently used data/instructions for quick access    |
| 📍 **Location**       | Installed on the motherboard as separate modules              | Built into or close to the CPU core                          |
| ⚡ **Speed**          | Fast, but slower than cache                                   | Extremely fast                                              |
| 📏 **Size**           | Larger (4GB–64GB or more)                                     | Smaller (2MB–64MB typically)                                |
| 🧪 **Types**          | DDR4, DDR5, etc.                                               | L1, L2, L3 cache levels                                      |
| ⏱️ **Access Time**    | Higher latency than cache                                     | Very low latency                                             |
| 🔋 **Volatility**     | Volatile (data lost when power is off)                        | Also volatile                                                |
| ⚙️ **Control**        | Managed by the operating system                               | Managed by the CPU                                           |

## Why Do We Need Cache?
The CPU is incredibly fast, but accessing data from the main memory (RAM) takes comparatively longer. To bridge this speed gap, cache memory acts as a super-fast, small storage area located very close to the CPU.

Cache stores frequently used data and instructions, so the CPU can access them quickly without waiting for slower RAM.

This reduces the average time to access memory, improving overall system performance.

Without cache, the CPU would spend more time idling, waiting for data to arrive from RAM, slowing down computing tasks.

## ⚡ What is POST?
POST (Power-On Self-Test) is the initial diagnostic testing sequence your computer performs immediately after you power it on. It checks hardware components like CPU, RAM, GPU, storage devices, and peripherals to make sure everything is working correctly before the operating system loads.

If POST detects a problem, it usually reports it through beep codes, error messages, or indicator lights, preventing the system from booting until the issue is fixed.

### 🔍 POST vs BIOS vs Boot

| Term       | What It Is                                         | When It Happens               | What It Does                                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **POST**   | Power-On Self-Test — hardware diagnostic test     | Immediately after powering on | Checks hardware components (RAM, CPU, GPU, etc.) to ensure they work properly before loading anything else |
| **BIOS**   | Basic Input/Output System — firmware on motherboard | After POST                   | Initializes hardware, configures devices, provides low-level system control, and starts the bootloader process |
| **Boot**   | The process of loading the operating system        | After BIOS finishes          | Loads the OS from storage (HDD/SSD) into memory so you can use your computer |

# 🔌 RJ45 Connector, Crimping Tools & Ethernet Cable

| Term             | What It Is                                              | Purpose / Use                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **RJ45 Connector**| A common 8-pin connector used for network cables        | Connects Ethernet cables to devices like computers, routers, and switches |
| **Crimping Tool** | A hand tool used to attach RJ45 connectors to cables    | Cuts, strips, and crimps cable wires into the connector for a secure connection |
| **Ethernet Cable**| Cable used to connect devices in a local network        | Transfers data between devices such as computers, routers, and modems |


## How to make RJ45 cable:
Strip the cable to remove 1 inch of the outer sheath.
Untwist and straighten the wires inside of the cable
Arrange the wires into the right order.
|Pin|	Wire Color|
|------|--------|
|1	|White-Orange|
|2	|orange|
|3	|White-Green|
|4|	Blue|
|5|	White-Blue|
|6|	Green|
|7|	White-Brown|
|8|	Brown|
Trim the wires into an even line 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) from sheathing
Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector.
Stick the connector into the crimping part of the tool and squeeze twice.
Remove the cable from the tool and check that all of the pins are down & test the cable.
