### Definition of Dual Boot
Dual boot is a computer configuration in which two operating systems are installed on the same device, allowing the user to choose which one to start (or "boot") at startup.

### VMware:
VMware is a company that creates software for virtualization, and its products (like VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, and VMware ESXi) allow you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine — at the same time.
### Bare Metal Installation:
A bare metal installation means installing an operating system or software directly onto the hardware of a computer, without any underlying host OS or virtualization layer.

### Partitioning Scheme — Definition and Overview
A partitioning scheme is the way a hard drive or storage device is divided into separate, independent sections called partitions. Each partition can hold a different filesystem or operating system.

MBR (Master Boot Record)	Traditional partitioning scheme used since early PCs. Contains partition table and bootloader code in the first sector
GPT (GUID Partition Table)	Modern scheme that stores partition info using globally unique IDs. Supports larger disks and more partitions.

 # Day3:

chmod 444 filename.sh: Changes file to read-only
